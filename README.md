# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

一、todoList案例相关知识点
1、拆分组件、实现静态组件，注意：classsName、style的写法
2、动态初始化列表，如何确定将数据放在哪个组件的state中？
   ————某个组件使用：放在其自身的state中
   ————某些组件使用：放在他们共同的父组件state中(此操作称为：状态提升)
3、关于父子之间通信：
   1、「父组件」给「子组件」传递数据：通过props传递
   2、「子组件」给「父组件」传递数据：通过props传递，要求父提前给子传递一个函数
4、注意defaultChecked 和 checked 的区别，类似的还有：
   defaultValue 和 value
5、状态在哪里，操作状态的方法就在哪里
